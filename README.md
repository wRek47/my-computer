# My Computer
-- Information about how I configure my operating systems and networks, manage my systems, tools and projects, backup my data, troubleshoot issues, and otherwise improve modern technologies and user-experience to aide in the use and personal value of modern technology.

IE: I'm a computer guy, and being a computer guy, I like to have all my good-to-know stuff, in a great, big, good-to-know pile-of-stuff.
The machine, My Computer, is where I connect that "pile of stuff" into a "complex entanglement" of "interactive tools" and "information networks" that are the "30 tabs and windows running in the background" that lag your computer (but not my own, mwahahahahahaha).
